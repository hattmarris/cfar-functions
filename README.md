CFAR Service Request Plugin

This is an open source WordPress plugin built for the Center for Aids Research at UNC-Chapel Hill. The plugin requires Gravity Forms, Members and WP Awesome support plugins.  It also uses the MPDF library and the Custom Metaboxes for Wordpress library.   We chose Gravity Forms simply as a front-end form builder with UI so that users can adjust fields easily.  The WP Awesome Support plugin is extended as a base ticketing system and customized to suit the needs of tracking service requests and producing grant reports for The Center.

The NIH has strict formatting requirements for NIH grant reporting.  This plugin makes use of MPDF to completely format a report using PHP and data from the system.
